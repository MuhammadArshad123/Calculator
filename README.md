# Calculator

This calculator project taught me Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, CSS Grid, and how to combine CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve more complicated layouts. It was difficult to correctly account for all the nuances that come with a calculator (for example not being able to click the period button twice) so the project exposed me to more subtle tools in Javascript such as using switches.
